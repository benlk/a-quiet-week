# A Quiet Week: A game about making the news

*This is [a proposed session at SRCCON 2017](https://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/#proposal-743908).

This session will adapt the freeform map-building game [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year/) to the context of a newsroom, with players playing as themselves within a newsroom covering a big story on a four-day deadline. A deck of cards is split into four suits; each suit represents a day and each card an hour. Draw a card, read the prompt, and determine how it affects your story in progress. The goal is to make it to the deadline with everything you need to publish the story.

After 55 minutes of play, we'll come back together to talk about sources of tension between different aspects of the newsroom, ways that people worked together, and how you might have handled things differently given a second chance.

See the [issues](https://github.com/benlk/a-quiet-week/issues) on this project for a roadmap of development.
