# Code of Conduct

## Preamble

Codes of conducts generally apply to places where people come together. A Quiet Week is in two such places: this repository and the community surrounding it, and the places where players play this game.

Players and the venues hosting them have made, or will have made, decisions about codes of conduct appropriate to their venue and attendance. A Quiet Year does not need to provide a code of conduct in those situations for conduct outside the realm of the game's own rules.

The contributors to A Quiet Week form a community overlapping with, but distinct from, the players of the game. And for that reason, this repository contains a code of conduct.

## The actual code of conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission. 
	- This includes contributing scenarios to the game that divulge non-public conduct without anonymization and/or permission.
		- if it happened in private, anonymize it and get permission
		- if it happened in the newsroom/at work, anonymize it or get permission
		- if it happened in public or on Twitter, anonymize it
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS][INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

(Note from @benlk, 2017-05-04: This project is not yet big enough that I'm going
to maintain a dedicated email address for it; if you need to get in touch,
please email me at benlkeith+aqy@gmail.com. This may hopefully change in the future)

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
